Thank you for purchasing EasyRoads3D Pro

This package includes the EasyRoads3D Pro tool and a simple demo scene.

It is recommended to spend some time getting familiar with the tool before starting to use it in your projects. 

The manual is located in the EasyRoads3D root director. The first pages of the manual explain the main work flow.

To get familiar with the tool you can also download the free demo project: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/easyroads3d-demo-project-105045

The demo package includes many assets. It is recommended to import in a new project first. It can be imported in your project 
if you want to use all assets. Otherwise assets can be exported / imported. 

It includes featured zones with links to tutorials on our website, http://easyroads3d.com/tutorials.php. 

The demo project also includes a variety of different road types and side objects
which can be used in your own personal and commercial projects except for asset store packages. 
Please contact us for permission to use these assets in Unity asset store packages or for example open source Unity projects.   

The legacy provisional beta demo project is part of the demo project as a separate Unity package.
